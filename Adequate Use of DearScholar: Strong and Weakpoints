Adequate use of DearScholar: strong and weakpoints

Below, the strong- and weakpoints of DearScholar have been elaborated on in relation to multiple research scenarios. This elaboration is based on practical experience with the DearScholar mobile tool in actual research setting. Other researchers that have used DearScholar for research purposes may add to this list.

Strongpoints:
-	User-friendly interface and features such as saving text, usernames and passwords (encoded) on the device
-	Automatic and adequate data-storage: no transcribing, little recoding
-	Highly accessible; diary fill-outs wherever and whenever
-	Possibility for (automated) push-notifications, which significantly stimulate response
-	Multiple security measures, such as biometrics and auto-lock on the front-end, as well as VPN-locks and secure data funneling on the back-end
-	Flexible. Both in overall design and context. Adjustable to a wide array of research purposes; from quantitative slider measurements to qualitative text-boxes. Also adjustable in terms of content; adjust, remove or fine-tune content and lay-outs during the course of the research
-	Unique options for longitudinal measurements; no tool as viable for longitudinal measurements as a flexible, accessible mobile application

Weakpoints:
-	Ethical approval for data-collection can be a challenge, especially when installed on respondentsâ€™ private mobiles
-	Some respondents will report a preference of filling out the diary on a computer instead of a mobile phone, especially older generations, but this feature is not yet supported
-	Having a researcher present during an on-site intake session for installing the application and troubleshooting is strongly recommended
-	Interaction feature is embedded in the application, but is not yet working properly
-	Entering large amounts of text in the textbox may provide some issues on a few devices, but this can be countered by setting a work-limit
-	Back-end database may display weird notations when certain punctuation marks are used by the respondents
